# MOBILE-APPLICATION-MOCK-UP-FLOOD-TIDAL-WAVE-EARLY-WARNING-SYSTEM

Flood and tidal waves continue to be major threats to coastal and low-lying communities, causing severe property damage, displacement, and loss of life. To address these challenges, Flood Alert has been developed as a mobile application designed to provide real-time early warnings, risk mapping, and disaster response assistance. The application specifically targets Kelantan, Malaysia and integrated Indonesian Disaster Dataset Based on Type for Technology-Based Disaster Management and Mitigation data, OpenStreetMap, and user-generated reports to enhance situational awareness and disaster preparedness. The application is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, OpenStreetMap API, and Fetch API, ensuring a user-friendly, responsive, and effective experience. Key features include personalized alerts, interactive risk maps, safety guidelines, emergency contact information, a reporting system, and specialized features for women’s groups to promote inclusivity and accessibility. By leveraging real-time notifications, Flood Alert ensures that users receive critical information instantly, allowing for quick decision-making and timely evacuations. During development, several challenges were encountered, including API integration complexities, real-time data accuracy, and ensuring accessibility for all user groups. These challenges were addressed through continuous testing, feedback-driven improvements, and optimizations of data synchronization. The system’s architecture is designed for efficient data management and real-time alert dissemination, ensuring reliability in emergency situations. Future enhancements may include AI-driven predictive analytics, offline functionality for crucial information, expanded geographic coverage, and deeper collaboration with government agencies and NGOs. Overall, Flood Alert is a vital disaster management tool, empowering communities with accurate, timely information and practical disaster preparedness strategies. By leveraging technology, the application aims to reduce the impact of natural disasters, save lives, and enhance community resilience in flood-prone areas.
